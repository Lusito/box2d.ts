/**
 * A map, so b2Readonly can determine the readonly properties of a Type
 *
 * The key should be the name of the type to be readonly-fied. The value is a tuple with 3 parts:
 * - The type that can be made readonly
 * - The properties that should be picked from that type
 * - A manual set of properties to be added to the readonly type.
 *   Use this to specify properties which need to use b2Readonly.
 *   Set it to `unknown` if there is no need for manual properties
